Improved Quizlet to Anki Importer
=================================

I love Anki, but many of my classmates use Quizlet. So, here we go...

**Why It's Better Than The Other Quizlet Add Ons**

* All you've gotta do is enter the URL to a **Quizlet** deck
* Imports public decks and any associated pictures
* Has decent error handling, like letting you know if a deck is private
* Doesn't make a bunch of new note types every time you **import a deck**
* **Well documented code in case you want to modify or fork it yourself**

**How To Use**

**After installing (see bottom of page), restart Anki and navigate to Toolsâ†’Import from Quizlet**

**Tip**

**Here's a good [two-minute YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7sUUGakIhs) (not mine) for changing note types on Quizlet cards you may have imported. Sometimes people switch the terms and definitions, and you can flip them back in Anki if you need to.**
